<h1>Roberto's Art and Comics Website</h1>

This is my first photo gallery featuring art made from my own portfolio. 
Inside are three art abstract art pieces I made in the art section link.
After that are the images of a single comic in the Comics section link.

<h2>HTML</h2>
All the pages are linked and maintain the image placement using PNG formatted
images.

<h2>Pictures</h2>
All the images were made using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop tools.

<h2>CSS features </h2>
CSS features are included with development. 
When viewing on the desktop this includes a lightbox feature combined with
the CSS and has media queries for mobile-first viewing. They also have a
hover over feature that eases them in and out for viewing before clicking 
on them. Also included is a CSS reset to maintain the stylesheet programming
as well as rendering.

<h2>Javascript</h2>
The javascript features include lightbox for desktop and mobile.
The images have a Onclick action that make a shadowed backround with a 
box appear in the desktop version. This feature is ignored in the mobile
since the images are big enough to be seen.

The entire project was created using Visual Studio Code ver. 1.36.1
